# Business Model

At Lore Loom, we believe in fostering a sustainable and thriving ecosystem that supports the creative endeavors of our community members while ensuring the long-term viability of our platform. Our business model is designed to provide multiple revenue streams that enable us to continue innovating, expanding, and delivering value to our users.&#x20;

Here's how we plan to monetize our platform:

1. **Subscription Services:**
   * We offer subscription tiers with varying levels of access and benefits for users who wish to engage more deeply with Lore Loom's features and community.
   * Subscribers gain access to premium content, exclusive workshops, and advanced tools for storytelling and collaboration.
   * Monthly or annual subscription plans provide a recurring revenue stream that sustains ongoing platform development and support.
2. **Commissions:**
   * Lore Loom acts as a marketplace for artists and creators to showcase and sell their artwork directly to our community members.
   * We earn commissions on art sales facilitated through our platform, providing a source of revenue while empowering artists to monetize their work and expand their reach.
   * Commissions are structured as a percentage of the total transaction value, ensuring that both Lore Loom and the artists benefit from successful sales.
3. **Direct Percentages of 1-1 Art Sales:**
   * In addition to commissions from art sales, Lore Loom may also offer 1-1 art sales services where users can commission custom artwork from talented creators within our community.
   * We earn a direct percentage of the transaction value for each 1-1 art sale facilitated through our platform, providing a fair and transparent revenue model for both parties involved.
   * This revenue stream incentivizes continued engagement and collaboration within the Lore Loom community while supporting the platform's growth and sustainability.

**Revenue Distribution:**

* Revenue generated through subscription services, commissions, and direct percentages of 1-1 art sales is reinvested into platform development, community initiatives, and operational expenses.
* A portion of revenue may also be allocated towards marketing and outreach efforts to expand our user base and attract new creators and enthusiasts to the Lore Loom ecosystem.
* We remain committed to transparency and accountability in revenue distribution, ensuring that our business practices align with our mission of empowering creativity and community engagement.
