‚ö°Ô∏è Engage both members and newcomers with art

üé® Raise funds from a constant flow of artwork

*   How does governance data get transformed into art?

    Almost magic! This is the high-level of how the loom works:

    1. When the community submits governance data that meets preset criteria, the Loom Engine kicks in, processing this data with settings to initiate artifact creation.
    2. Artists contribute art components to a dedicated database, which the Loom Engine then merges with onchain data to produce distinctive artifacts.
    3. Created artifacts are turned into NFTs for community use‚Äîawarded, collected, or sold, embodying the art and history they depict.
*   What types of art forms can be generated?

    The sky's the limit! From lush digital gardens that expand with each new vote to epic quests that unfold based on governance decisions (or even jokes!), Lore Loom can craft a variety of art forms. We're always exploring new ways to loom data in creative ways, so expect the unexpected!
*   How often do the art pieces evolve with new data?

    **As the blockchain lives and breathes**, so does the art on Lore Loom. Every time preset onchain criteria are met, the related art piece morphs to reflect that change. It keeps things fresh and continuously engaging.
*   What are the plans for Lore Loom?

    We're dreaming big! Think more interactivity, more ‚Äúonchainess‚Äù and decentralization. Collaborations with artists and onchain projects, and even physical installations. Lore Loom is on a mission to keep pushing the boundaries of what blockchain art can be.
* Why is the Lore Loom important? \
  The Loom **mitigates coordination failures by addressing voter apathy and low engagement** in blockchain governance. It converts voting data into captivating art, reinvigorating participant involvement and making the process more accessible.\
  The Loom underscores the fundamental truth that change‚Äîreal, lasting change‚Äîbegins with the stories we tell ourselves about who we are, what we value, and how we interact with the world around us. From the myths that saved patches of forest by cloaking them in sacred mystery, to the proliferation of concepts that redefined our social structures, we've always been shaped by the stories we tell. This knowledge-telling artistry translates the often abstract, complex environmental and policy issues into stories that touch more than rational minds, sparking action through heartfelt meaning-making.

By marrying this data with the imaginative power of artists‚Äô co-ops, the Loom crafts narratives not so easily ignored‚Äîstreams of stories, of art.&#x20;
