  Through the Loom, governance data—a record of decisions made, actions taken,
  and policies enacted—becomes the skeleton of new myths, the foundation of
  legends for tomorrow.

# Our Solution

By marrying this data with the imaginative power of artists’ co-ops, the Loom crafts narratives not so easily ignored—streams of stories, of art. The Loom underscores the fundamental truth that change—real, lasting change—begins with the stories we tell ourselves about who we are, what we value, and how we interact with the world around us. From the myths that saved patches of forest by cloaking them in sacred mystery, to the proliferation of concepts that redefined our social structures, we've always been shaped by the stories we tell. This knowledge-telling artistry translates the often abstract, complex environmental and policy issues into stories that touch more than rational minds, sparking action through heartfelt meaning-making.
