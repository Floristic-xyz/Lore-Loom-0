# Product Overview

Welcome to Lore Loom, where storytelling, governance, and creativity converge to help you shape the future of the internet. It is designed to empower community members to participate in immersive narratives that reflect the ethos of DAOsâ€”a vision of participation, adaptability, and possibility.

Lore Loom includes the following features:

* **Composable settings**: When a community wants to use the Loom, they fill out a form with the information and pick several integrated options for data sources (like EAS or Snapshot) and outputs (EAS or multiple NFTs types).
* **Fetching onchain data**: The looming starts by pulling relevant data from sources based on that community's settings.&#x20;
* **Data processing**: Raw data is turned into blueprints for assembling artwork. The blueprints' relation to the source data can vary from a simple randomness seed to keyword correlation to tailor-made.&#x20;
* **Composable art**: The assembled artwork is then minted as static, dynamic, or evolving NFT. The art can be used as funding source, as reputation, reward, even chaining related works for a sense of continuity, and much more.
* **Incremental benefits**: The more it is used by communities individually and as a whole, the better it gets from compounding benefits like chaining relevant artworks or forming community lore around such collections.
