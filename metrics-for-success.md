# Metrics for Success

We believe in measuring success not only by traditional business metrics but also by our impact on our community and the fulfillment of our mission. Here's how we define success for our project:

#### User Engagement

1. **Artwork Interaction Rate**: Tracks how frequently users engage with the generated art, such as viewing, sharing, or commenting.
2. **Satisfaction Surveys:** Conduct regular surveys to gather feedback from community members on their experience with Lore Loom, including satisfaction levels, feature requests, and suggestions for improvement.

#### Financial Health

3. **Revenue from Premium Features**: Quantifies income generated from subscribers or purchasers of the platform's premium services.
4. **NFT Sales Volume**: Indicates the total value of NFTs sold through the platform, reflecting both the popularity and financial viability of the art.

#### Community Growth

5. **Community Contributions**: Measures the volume and diversity of contributions from the community, including art submissions and feedback.

#### Platform Development

7. **Feature Adoption Rate**: Evaluates how quickly and widely new features are adopted by the user base after release.

#### Sustainability and Impact

9. **Public Goods Contributions**: Measures the direct financial or in-kind contributions made to other public goods projects, reflecting the platform's broader social impact.
