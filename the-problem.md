# The Problem

Governance, as traditionally perceived, is often characterized by its dry, technical nature, leading to widespread disengagement and apathy among community members. The lack of excitement and accessibility surrounding governance processes poses a significant challenge for communities striving to foster meaningful participation and collaboration.

With their extrinsic motivation incentives, traditional governance frameworks fail to capture the imagination or inspire active involvement from community members. Instead, they often feel disconnected and detached from the realities of everyday life, resulting in low voter turnout, limited engagement, and a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making.

This disconnect between governance and community engagement represents a critical problem. Without meaningful participation from community members, governance processes risk becoming stagnant and unresponsive to the needs and aspirations of the people they serve, leading to coordination failures.
